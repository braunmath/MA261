  <title>Conjecture Requires Experimental Verification and Proof</title>

 <p>
  We have now explored different approaches to understanding the sum <m>1+2+3+\cdots+n</m> for positive integers <m>n</m>, and it led us to conjecture that
    <me>
      1+2+3+\cdots +n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \, .
    </me>
  So... what do we do now? 
  </p>

  <principle xml:id="principle-testmore">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Test conjectures with as many experiments as possible!
      </p>
    </statement>
  </principle>

  <p>
    Let's put this principle into practice using SageMath by testing our conjecture for the first 10,000 positive integers <m>n</m>.
    <program lang="sage">
    for n in range(1,10001):
        S = sum([k for k in range(1, n+1)])
        formula = n*(n+1)/2
        if S != formula:
            print("Conjecture is false at n ="+str(n))
        if n % 1000 == 0:
            print("Conjecture is true up to n="+str(n))
    </program>
    This provides stronger evidence that our conjecture is correct, but it is still not a proof.
  </p>

  <p>
    So, now that we have a conjecture that is supported by experimental evidence, we need to (A) determine if it is <em>actually</em> true and (B) if it is true, we need to give a clear explanation of <em>why</em> it is true.
    This means we need a mathematical proof.
    Unfortunately, "mathematical proof" is a more complicated topic than one might expect.
    The standards for what a "rigorous" proof is depends on context, audience, and purpose.
    It also depends on what "world" of mathematics you are working in.

    In this class, we will rely on a framework developed by David Tall in his book <url href="https://www.cambridge.org/us/universitypress/subjects/psychology/educational-psychology/how-humans-learn-think-mathematically-exploring-three-worlds-mathematics">How Humans Learn to Think Mathematically: Exploring the Three Worlds of Mathematics</url>.
    You will read more about this framework and reflect on it for Essay 1.

  <p>
    Our goal is to give three different proofs of our conjecture, one proof representing each of the three worlds of mathematics.
