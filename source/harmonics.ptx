  <title>Harmonics and Temperament</title>

<p>
  We are now able to develop our first applications of number theory to music theory, specifically the theory of harmonics and temperament.
  For a detailed treatment of mathematical aspects of music, including the way that the physiology of the ear influences perception of music, see David Benson's 2008 book <url href="https://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/d.j.benson/pages/html/maths-music.html">Music: A Mathematical Offering</url>.
</p>

<p>
  Sound waves occur as sequences of high and low pressure moving through air, i.e., as an oscillation of pressure.
  Sound is perceived through our ears as a sequence of "beats" of pressure.
  The number of beats that is heard per second is the <em>frequency</em> of the wave, which is measured in <em>Hertz</em>.
  One Hertz, written as <m>1</m> Hz, is equal to one beat per second.
  The human ear can perceive frequencies ranging from around 20 Hz to between 16,000 and 20,000 Hz.
</p>

<p>
  An aside for those students who have musical experience: in this class, we will use the term "frequency" rather than "pitch", because they are technically different; pitch is the human perception of frequency, which does not always correspond accurately to the physical frequency.
  However, for typical musical purposes, the words pitch and frequency are used as synonyms.
</p>

<p>
  We can experience "pure" sound waves using a tone generator, such as <url href="https://onlinesound.net/oscillator-modulator"/>.
  Let's experiment listening to the following frequencies:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        1 Hz using a square wave (this is 1 beat per second), then increase to 440 Hz (which is a concert "A" pitch).
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        20 Hz using a sine wave (this is a smoothly-varying pressure wave with 20 high pressure beats per second), then increase to 880 Hz.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  A natural way to think about sound waves is as a sequence of beats, or pulses of pressure.
  When those beats are synchronized in some way, they are aligned.
  For example, consider the sound of two simultaneous sine waves, one at 220 Hz and one at 440 Hz, using <url href="https://onlinesound.net/oscillator-modulator"/>.
  What is happening is that we hear 220 beats per second from one wave, and 440 beats per second from another.
  Thus, these are impacting our ear in a synchronized manner.
</p>
<p>  
  Next, listen to what happens when we add another wave at 660 Hz, which is three times the original wave in frequency.
  This is the sound of three simultaneous sound waves, where the lowest has frequency <m>f=220</m> Hz, and the other two have frequencies <m>2f=440</m> and <m>3f=660</m>.
</p>

<p>
  We typically represent the sequence of beats as a sine wave. 
  For example, the following figure shows four frequencies which are a fundamental frequency <m>f</m> with a single peak, along with the sine waves corresponding to <m>2f</m>, <m>3f</m>, and <m>4f</m>.
</p>
<figure xml:id="fig-frequencies">
  <caption>Four frequencies, three of which are small multiples of the fundamental frequency.</caption>
  <image source="frequencies.png">
    <shortdescription>Four sine waves where three are obtained as small multiples of the frequency of another.</shortdescription>
  </image>
</figure>

<exercise>
  <p>
    Discuss the figure above.
    Does it make sense how the peaks and valleys of the sine wave correspond to the beats in a given time interval?
  </p>
</exercise>

<p>
  What happens when we cut out the original frequency, and only play the frequencies for <m>2f</m> and <m>3f</m>?
  It sounds different, because the ratio of beats per second is different between <m>2f</m> and <m>3f</m> than between <m>f</m> and <m>2f</m>.
  Specifically, when we listen to <m>f</m> and <m>2f</m>, then we are hearing 2 beats of the second frequency for each beat of the first frequency, giving a ratio of <m>2:1</m>.
  However, when we listen to <m>2f</m> and <m>3f</m>, then we are hearing 3 beats of the third frequency for every 2 beats of the second frequency, giving a ratio of <m>3:2</m>.
  This leads us to a fundamental observation: <alert>when considering a pair of frequencies, what matters for our perception of their interaction is the ratio of their frequencies</alert>.

    Discuss the following concepts with your group. What questions do you have about them?
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Hertz as beats per minute
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Sound as sequences of "beats" of pressure in the air being sensed by our ears
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Using the <alert>ratio</alert> between two frequencies to measure how those frequencies are related.

 We are now in a position to give precise mathematical definitions for some musical terms.
</p>

<definition xml:id="def-intervals">
  <statement>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Given two frequencies <m>f_1</m> Hz and <m>f_2</m> Hz, the <em>interval</em> from <m>f_1</m> to <m>f_2</m> is given by the ratio <m>f_1:f_2</m>.
            If two ratios are equivalent as fractions, then we say that they define the same interval.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Two frequencies differ by an <em>octave</em> if their interval is <m>2:1</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Two frequencies differ by a <em>fifth</em> if their interval is <m>3:2</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            A <em>scale</em> is any sequence of notes starting at a root frequency <m>f</m> and ending at the octave <m>2f</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  </statement>
</definition>

<exercise>
  <p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          What frequency is two octaves above 236 Hz?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          What frequency is one fifth above 440 Hz?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          What frequency is three fifths above 220 Hz?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          What frequency is one octave above the fifth above 440 Hz?
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
</exercise>

<p>
  Intervals and fifths play a fundamental role in many musical traditions around the world.
  Part of the reason for this is because the ratios for octaves and fifths involve fractions with small integer values.
  A classical construction of musical scales, which arose in multiple ancient cultures, is a construction of musical scales using only octaves and fifths.
  Any scale constructed using only octaves and fifths is referred to as a <em>Pythagorean scale</em>.
