  <title>Consequences of the Fundamental Theorem</title>

<p>
  We will now investigate consequences of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.
</p>

<lemma xml:id="lem-euclidslemma">
  <title>Euclid's Lemma</title>  
  <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>p</m> be a prime.
      If <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are natural numbers such that <m>p\mid ab</m>, then <m>p\mid a</m> or <m>p\mid b</m>.
    </p>
  </statement>
</lemma>

<proof>
  <p>
    Write the prime factorizations <m>a=p_1^{\alpha_1}\cdots p_k^{\alpha_k}</m> and <m>b=q_1^{\beta_1}\cdots q_t^{\beta_t}</m>.
    Then we have
    <me>
      ab = p_1^{\alpha_1}\cdots p_k^{\alpha_k}q_1^{\beta_1}\cdots q_t^{\beta_t} \, .
    </me>
    If <m>p</m> divides the product, then <m>p</m> must appear in the list of primes in the factorization of <m>ab</m>.
    Therefore, <m>p</m> must be a divisor of one or both of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
  </p>
</proof>

<exercise>
  <p>
    With your group, work through the logic of this proof using <m>p=7</m> and the numbers <m>a=105=3\cdot 5\cdot 7</m> and <m>b=231=3\cdot 7\cdot 11</m>.
    Does the proof make sense? Why or why not?
  </p>
</exercise>

<corollary xml:id="cor-factordivisorform">
  <statement>
    <p>
      Suppose that <m>b=p_1^{\beta_1}\cdots p_k^{\beta_k}</m>.
      If <m>a</m> is any divisor of <m>b</m>, then 
      <me>
        a = p_1^{\alpha_1}\cdots p_k^{\alpha_k}
      </me>
      Where each <m>\alpha_i\leq \beta_i</m>.      
    </p>
  </statement>
</corollary>

<proof>
  <p>
    If <m>p^\alpha</m> divides <m>a</m> and <m>a\mid b</m>, then <m>p^{\alpha} \mid b</m>.
    Thus, any power of a prime dividing <m>a</m> must also divide <m>b</m>.
  </p>
</proof>

<p>
  We next define the greatest common divisor and least common multiple of two numbers, and express these quantities in terms of prime factorizations.
</p>

<definition xml:id="def-gcdlcm">
  <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> be natural numbers.
      The <em>greatest common divisor</em> of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, denoted <m>\gcd(a,b)</m>, is given by the largest natural number dividing both <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
      If <m>\gcd(a,b)=1</m>, we say that <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are <em>coprime</em>.
      The <em>least common multiple</em> of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> , denoted <m>\lcm(a,b)</m>, is given by the smallest natural number divisible by both <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
    </p>
  </statement>
</definition>

<exercise>
  <p>
    Find the greatest common divisor and the least common multiple for the following pairs of numbers.
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          5, 11
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          15, 36
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          367, 854
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
</exercise>

<p>
  Using prime factorizations, it is straightforward to determine these values.
</p>

<proposition xml:id="prop-gcdlcmfactorizations">
  <statement>
    <p>
      Suppose <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are natural numbers.
      If <m>p</m> is a prime such that <m>p^{\alpha}</m> appears in the prime factorization of <m>a</m> and <m>p^{\beta}</m> appears in the prime factorization of <m>b</m>, then:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>p^{\min(\alpha,\beta)}</m> appears in the prime factorization of <m>\gcd(a,b)</m>, and
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>p^{\max(\alpha,\beta)}</m> appears in the prime factorization of <m>\lcm(a,b)</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  </statement>
</proposition>

<proof>
  <p>
    The proposition is a consequence of the following two observations.
    The largest power of <m>p</m> that divides both <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> is the minimum of the two exponents.
    The smallest power of <m>p</m> that is divisible by both <m>p^{\alpha}</m> and <m>p^{\beta}</m> is the maximum of the two exponents.
  </p>
</proof>

<exercise>
  <p>
    Discuss the above "sketch" of the proof with your group.
    Are you convinced by this? Do you feel it needs more details? Why or why not?

<p>
  The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic is also the key ingredient in many classical proofs of irrationality.
  Here are three examples.
</p>

<theorem xml:id="thm-sqrt2irrational">
  <statement>
    <p>
      The value <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is irrational.
    </p>
  </statement>
</theorem>

<proof>
  <p>
    Suppose for a contradiction that <m>\sqrt{2}=a/b</m> for natural numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> where the fraction is fully reduced; in other words, <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are coprime.
    Then squaring both sides, we have that
    <me>
      2=a^2/b^2
    </me>
    and therefore <m>2b^2=a^2</m>.
    However, this implies that there are an odd number of <m>2</m>s in the prime factorization of the left side, while there are an even number in the prime factorization on the right.
    This is a contradiction, and therefore <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is not rational.    
  </p>
</proof>

<exercise xml:id="ex-twelfthtwo">
  <p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Discuss this proof. Does it make sense? Why or why not?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Modify this proof to show that <m>\sqrt[12]{2}</m> is irrational.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
</exercise>

<theorem xml:id="thm-log32irrational">
  <statement>
    <p>
      The value <m>\log_2(3/2)</m> is irrational.
    </p>
  </statement>
</theorem>

<proof>
  <p>
    Suppose for contradiction that <m>\log_2(3/2)=a/b</m> for coprime numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
    Then we have that <m>\log_2((3/2)^b)=a</m>, which implies that
    <me>
      (3/2)^b=2^a \, .
    </me>
    This implies that 
    <me>
      3^b=2^{a+b} \, ,
    </me>
    which is impossible by the uniqueness of prime factorization, yielding the desired contradiction.
  </p>
</proof>
