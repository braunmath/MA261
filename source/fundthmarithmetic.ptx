  <title>The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic</title>

  <p>
    <xref ref="thm-primesdividenumbers"/> established that every natural number greater than <m>1</m> is divisible by a prime.
    This leads to a question: exactly which primes divide a natural number?
    Is it possible to give two different sets of primes that multiply together to give the same number?
  </p>

  <p>
    The answer to this question is the following, which is a something most of you learned as a "fact" in elementary and middle school.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="thm-fundthmarithmetic">
    <title>The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Every natural number greater than <m>1</m> can be written as a product of primes, and this product is unique for each number.
        Symbolically, given a natural number <m>n\gt 1</m>, there exist distinct primes <m>p_1,\ldots,p_k</m> and non-negative exponents <m>a_1,\ldots,a_k\in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}</m> such that
        <me>
          n = p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\cdots p_k^{a_k}
        </me>
        and the primes and exponents are unique up to reordering of factors.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <exercise>

      Find the prime factorizations for the following numbers.
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>380</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>927</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>

    We will prove existence of factorizations and uniqueness of factorizations separately.
    This proof closely follows the one given for <url href="https://bookstore.ams.org/view?ProductCode=AMSTEXT/58">Theorem 1.6.5 in Cioaba and Linde's <em>A Bridge to Advanced Mathematics</em></url>.

  <proof>
    <title>Proof of existence of prime factorizations</title>
    <p>
      First, we will show that such a factorization exists, using strong induction.
      Our base case is <m>n=2</m>, which is prime.
      For the (strong) induction step, let <m>m</m> be a positive integer and assume that every natural number <m>1\leq k\leq m</m> has a prime factorization.
      We want to prove that <m>m+1</m> also has a prime factorization.
      If <m>m+1</m> is prime, then we are done.
      If not, then <m>m+1</m> must have some prime divisor <m>p</m> such that <m>1\lt p\lt m+1</m>, so that means there exists a number <m>c</m> such that
      <me>
        m+1=cp \, .
      </me>
      By induction, <m>c</m> has a prime factorization 
      <me>
        c=p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\cdots p_k^{a_k}\, .
      </me>
      If we multiply this by <m>p</m>, we obtain a prime factorization for <m>m+1</m>.
      Therefore, prime factorizations exist by induction.

      Second, we will show that each factorization is unique, using a proof by contradiction.

    While the fundamental theorem of arithmetic might seem obvious, the above proof shows that it it not as obvious as it seems.
    Further, the existence and uniqueness of prime factorization unlocks subtle and deep questions in mathematics.
    One of these questions is the "Mertens Conjecture", a conjecture that was stated in 1885 by Stieltjes and which was proved false in 1985 by Odlyzko and te Riele.
    Let's watch the following 9-minute Numberphile video from January 2020 in which Dr. Holly Krieger discusses Merterns' Conjecture.
