  <title>The Division Algorithm</title>

  <p>
    In this chapter, we will explore divisibility of integers in more detail.
    We begin with the following problem.
  </p>

  <assumption xml:id="question-lineardiophantine">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Which triples of positive integers <m>a,b,c</m> have integer solutions <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> to the equation <me>ax+by=c \, ?</me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </assumption>

  <exercise>
    <p>
      Investigate which values of <m>c</m> yield an integer solution <m>x,y</m> for each of the following equations.
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>2x+3y=c</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>4x+10y=c</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>5x+7y=c</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>6x+9y=c</m>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  </exercise>

  <p>
    While it is not immediately obvious, this question is closely related to questions regarding greatest common divisors and divisibility, and thus this question motivates our study of divisibility.
    We will begin with a fundamental result about division of integers known as the division algorithm.
