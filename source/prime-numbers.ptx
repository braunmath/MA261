  <title>Numbers, Sets, and Primes</title>

  <p>
    Now that we have language allowing us to describe different aspects of mathematical reasoning and proof, we can begin our study of number theory.
    We will start with the study of prime numbers.
    First, let's define the types of numbers we will be discussing.
  </p>

  <definition xml:id="def-numbers">
    <statement>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              The set of <em>natural numbers</em> is the set <m>\mathbb{N}:=\{1, 2, 3, \ldots\}</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The set of <em>integers</em> is the set <m>\mathbb{Z}:=\{\ldots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots\}</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    Observe that we are using set notation above to define these families of numbers.
    We use "<m>:=</m>" to mean "is defined to be"; this is helpful when distinguishing between when we define something and when we are indicating equality.
    When we are defining a set, we often use curly braces <m>\{\}</m> to indicate the elements of the set and we specify the elements within the braces.
    One can use special notation within the braces to indicate a pattern for the elements of the set.
    For example, we can describe the natural numbers as
    <me>
      \mathbb{N} = \{ n \in \mathbb{Z} : n > 0 \} \, .
    </me>
    The symbol "<m>\in</m>" is read as "is an element of" or "belongs to".
    The ":" is read as "such that", so that the above set is read as "the set of all integers <m>n</m> such that <m>n</m> is greater than <m>0</m>".
  </p>

  <exercise>
    <p>
      Does the notation above make sense? Why or why not?
    </p>
  </exercise>

  <p>
  With this, we can define sets such as the <em>rational numbers</em>, which are the numbers in the set 
  <me>\mathbb{Q}:=\left\{\frac{a}{b} : a, b \in \mathbb{Z}, b \neq 0\right\} \, .</me>
  </p>

  <exercise>
    <p>
      Take turns reading the set-builder description of the rationals out loud as a sentence.
      Discuss <em>every symbol</em> used in the definition and talk about what that symbol represents.
    </p>
  </exercise>


  <definition xml:id="def-divisible">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> be integers with <m>b \neq 0</m>.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
                      We say that <m>a</m> is <em>divisible by</em> <m>b</m> if there exists an integer <m>k</m> such that <m>a = bk</m>.

            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                      If <m>a</m> is divisible by <m>b</m>, we also say that <m>b</m> <em>divides</em> <m>a</m> and we write <m>b \mid a</m>.

            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                      If <m>a</m> is not divisible by <m>b</m>, we write <m>b \nmid a</m>.

            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <example>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>5\mid 30</m> means that five divides thirty.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>6\nmid 17</m> means that six does not divide seventeen.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  </example>

  <p>
    We can combine set builder notation with these definitions to describe sets of numbers with certain divisibility properties.
    For example, the set of all integers that are divisible by <m>5</m> but not divisible by <m>6</m> is written as
    <me>
      \{ n \in \mathbb{Z} : 5 \mid n \text{ and } 6 \nmid n \} \, .
    </me>
    Note that if we tried to list the elements of this set, it would be hard to make it clear what the pattern is.
    For example, if we wrote the set above as
    <me>
      \{\ldots, -25, -20, -10, -5, 5, 10, 15, 25, \ldots\} \, ,
    </me>
    it would be unclear that <m>30</m> is not in the set.
    However, using the set-builder notation, two conditions are given following the ":" symbol that can be used to clearly determine that <m>30</m> is not in the set.
  </p>

  <exercise>
    <p>
      Use set builder notation and the notation for divisibility to write the following sets:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            The set of all natural numbers divisible by <m>3</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The set of all integers not divisible by <m>5</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The set of all natural numbers divisible by <m>4</m> but not by <m>6</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  </exercise>

  <p>
    Some of the most important natural numbers are the primes, defined as follows.
  </p>


  <definition xml:id="def-prime-number">
    <statement>
      <p>
      A <em>prime number</em> is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
      If a number is not prime, then it is <em>composite</em>.
      We will denote the set of prime numbers by <m>\mathbb{P}</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <exercise>
    <p>
      With your group, find the first ten prime numbers.
    </p>
  </exercise>

  <exercise>
    <p>
      With your group, use set builder notation to describe the set of all prime numbers that are three more than a multiple of four.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hint: You might need to write a longer phrase to the right of ":", for example, to describe what the remainder of <m>p</m> is after dividing by <m>4</m>.
    </p>
  </exercise>

  <p>
    Number theory is an ancient topic of study, with prime numbers being studied for thousands of years.
    We will begin with an old process to find primes.
  </p>

  <definition xml:id="def-sieveoferatosthenes">
    <statement>
      <p>
        The <em>Sieve of Eratosthenes</em> is a method to find all prime numbers between <m>2</m> and a given bound <m>N</m>.
        The process is as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Write down all the numbers from <m>2</m> to <m>N</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Start with the first number in the list (which is <m>2</m>).
              Circle it (it is prime) and then cross out all of its multiples.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Move to the next number that is not crossed out.
              Circle it (it is prime) and then cross out all of its multiples.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Repeat this process until you have processed each number up to <m>N</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        The numbers that remain uncrossed are all of the prime numbers between <m>2</m> and <m>N</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <exercise>
    <p>
      Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all prime numbers between <m>2</m> and <m>50</m>.
    </p>
  </exercise>

  <p>
    A visual illustration of the Sieve of Eratosthenes is given on the <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes">Wikipedia page for the Sieve</url>.
    Implicit in the Sieve of Eratosthenes is that the idea that every number is divisible by some prime number.
    Let's go ahead and prove that this is true.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="thm-primesdividenumbers">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Every natural number greater than 1 is divisible by a prime number.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <proof>
    <p>
      This proof closely follows the one given for <url href="https://bookstore.ams.org/view?ProductCode=AMSTEXT/58">Proposition 1.6.3 in Cioaba and Linde's <em>A Bridge to Advanced Mathematics</em></url>.
      We will prove this by strong induction <xref ref="principle-strong-induction"/>.
      The base case is <m>n = 2</m>, and the result is true in this case since <m>2</m> is prime.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the (strong) induction step, let <m>m</m> be a positive integer and assume that every natural number <m>1\leq k\leq m</m> has a prime divisor.
      We want to prove that <m>m+1</m> also has a prime divisor.
      If <m>m+1</m> is prime, then we are done.
      If not, then <m>m+1</m> must have some divisor <m>d</m> such that <m>1\lt d\lt m+1</m>, so that means there exists a number <m>c</m> such that
      <md>
        m+1=cd \, .
      </md>
      By our induction hypothesis, <m>d</m> has a prime divisor.
      So, there exists a number <m>a</m> and a prime <m>p</m> such that
      <me>
        d=ap \, .
      </me>
      Therefore, we have that
      <md>
        m+1=cd=cap 
      </md>
      and thus <m>p</m> is also a prime divisor of <m>m+1</m>, which finishes our proof.      
    </p>
  </proof>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            What do you think the two or three <em>key ideas</em> of this proof are?

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If you had to summarize this proof in one or two sentences, without using any symbols, what would you say?

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            In what way does the following picture give an embodied version of this proof?
