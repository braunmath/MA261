  <title>Embodied Proof</title>

  <p>
    Consider the following quote from David Tall in this paper: 
    <q>The first [world] grows out of our perceptions of the world and consists of our thinking about things that we perceive and sense, not only in the physical world, but in our own mental world of meaning. 
  By reflection and by the use of increasingly sophisticated language, we can focus on aspects of our sensory experience that enable us to envisage conceptions that no longer exist in the world outside, such as a 'line' that is 'perfectly straight'. 
  I now term this world the 'conceptual-embodied world' or 'embodied world' for short.
 </q>
