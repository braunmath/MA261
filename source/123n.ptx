  <title>Mathematics Begins With Questions</title>

  <p>
    Mathematical reasoning <em>always</em> begins with a question.
    Most students experience math in school, including in university, as a sequence of answers to questions that they have never heard asked.
    Don't believe this lie!
    Mathematics is about wondering, questioning, being curious, and making sense of the world.
    So let's begin with a question.
  </p>

  <assumption>
    <p>
    What is the value of the sum <m>1+2+3+\cdots+n</m> for different positive integer values of <m>n</m>?
    </p>
  </assumption>

      In this class, we will frequently engage in collaborative activities, which we will call checkpoints.
      Here are the expectations for checkpoints, which will usually either be a problem to solve or a question to discuss:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            First, begin the discussion by going around your group and having each person spend 10-seconds sharing an initial strategy for solving the problem, or sharing a answer to the question if it is a discussion question.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Second, go around the group again and give a 10-second follow-up answer. This allows everyone to have a chance to offer their thoughts before the general problem-solving or discussion begins.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Third, as a group, solve the problem or engage in the discussion for the checkpoint.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

  <exercise>
    <p>
      Discuss with your neighbors:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            What qualities would you want to see in a "good" answer to the question above?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            What are some different approaches that you could use to start trying to answer the question?
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
