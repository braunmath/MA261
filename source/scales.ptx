  <title>The Pythagorean Scale and Equal Temperament</title>

  <p> 
    Because of the critical role played by octaves and fifths, ancient cultures developed musical scales generated by those intervals.
    A scale is called <m>Pythagorean</m> if it is generated by octaves and fifths.
    As we will see, the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic forces such scales to have inherent dissonance, because of the answer to the following question.
  </p>

  <assumption xml:id="assumption-octavesandfifths">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose we start with a fundamental frequency <m>f</m> and we consider the sequence of octaves <m>2^af</m> for <m>a\geq 1</m> and fifths <m>(3/2)^b</m> for <m>b\geq 1</m>.
        Are there values of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> that produce the same frequency?
        In other words, can we produce the same frequency above <m>f</m> in two ways, one way using only octaves and another way using only fifths?
      </p>
    </statement>
  </assumption>

  <p>
    This question is important, because if there are no values <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> that do this, then going up by fifths and going up by octaves will never resolve to the same frequency.

  <theorem xml:id="thm-fifthoctaveissue">
    <statement>
      <p>
        There are no values of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> such that <m>2^af=(3/2)^bf</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <proof>
    <p>
      Suppose for a contradiction that such values did exist.
      This would imply the following:
      <md>
        <mrow>2^af \amp = (3/2)^bf \implies </mrow>
        <mrow> 2^a \amp = (3/2)^b \implies </mrow>
        <mrow> 2^{a/b} \amp = (3/2) </mrow>
      </md>
      Thus, we would have that <m>\log_2(3/2)=a/b</m>, which would imply that <m>\log_2(3/2)</m> is rational.
      However, we proved that this value is irrational in <xref ref="thm-log32irrational"/> using the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, which is a contradiction.
    </p>
  </proof>
  
  <p>
    The implications of this theorem is that the frequencies generated by using only octaves and fifths frequently produce dissonance.
