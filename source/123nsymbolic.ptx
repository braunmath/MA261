  <title>Symbolic Proof</title>

 <p>    
  Here is a description of the symbolic world from David Tall's paper "Building Theories: The Three Worlds of Mathematics", published in <em>For the Learning of Mathematics</em> in 2004 <url href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/40248444"/>.

    The <em>second</em> world is the world of symbols that we use for calculation and manipulation in arithmetic, algebra, calculus and so on. 
    These begin with <em>actions</em> (such as pointing and counting) that are encapsulated as concepts by using symbols that allow us to switch effortlessly from processes to <em>do</em> mathematics, to concepts to <em>think</em> about... 

    The initial stages of counting and early arithmetic are largely embodied. 
    But the focus on the properties of the symbols and the relationship between them moves away from the physical meaning to a symbolic activity in arithmetic. 
    This becomes increasingly sophisticated, with the introduction of more sophisticated number concepts (fractions, negatives, rationals, irrationals, infinite decimals, complex numbers, vectors in two and three, then n dimensions, and so on) that enable us to calculate and manipulate symbols with great accuracy and precision.

<p>
  An example of an <alert>embodied-symbolic</alert> proof of our conjecture for <m>n=6</m> is the following.
  Take two copies of our sum and add them together, but place one copy on top of the other, with the second set of summands appearing in the opposite order:
  <md>
    <mrow>\amp 1+2+3+4+5+6</mrow>
    <mrow>\amp 6+5+4+3+2+1</mrow>
    <mrow>\hline</mrow>
    <mrow>\amp 7+7+7+7+7+7</mrow>
  </md>
  When these two sums are added together, the summands pair to produce the sum of six copies of <m>7</m>.
  Thus, the initial sum, <m>1+2+3+4+5+6</m>, must be half of this total, is equal to half of <m>6 \times 7</m>, which is <m>21</m>.  
</p>

<p>
  This proof is embodied because it relies on visualizing the two sums being added together in this way, and because it relies on the physical action of pairing the summands.
  It is symbolic because it relies on manipulating the symbols of addition and equality to arrive at the conclusion.

  Next, let's look at a more general version of this proof that would be considered <alert>symbolic</alert>.
  When writing a proof that is more symbolic or formal (which we will discuss next), we usually will place our argument in a proof environment that begins with the word "Proof" and ends with either a small box symbol <m>\Box</m> or the letters "QED" (which stands for the Latin phrase <em>quod erat demonstrandum</em>, meaning "which was to be demonstrated").
  This is what you should do when writing your own symbolic and/or formal proofs.
</p>
  <p>
  In the proof below, we will use the sigma notation for sums.
  Remember that the notation
  <me>\sum_{i=1}^n a_i</me>
  means to sum the terms <m>a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_n</m>.
  Using this notation, our conjecture can be written as
  <me>\sum_{i=1}^n i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} .</me>
</p>

<proof>
  <title>Proof of <xref ref="conj-123nsum"/></title>
<p>
  We write the sum <me>S = \sum_{i=1}^n i</me> twice, once in the usual order and once in reverse order, and add them together:
  <md>
    <mrow>S+S \amp = \sum_{i=1}^n i + \sum_{i=1}^n (n+1-i)</mrow>
    <mrow> \amp = \sum_{i=1}^n (i + (n+1-i)) </mrow>
    <mrow>\amp = \sum_{i=1}^n (n+1)  </mrow>
    <mrow>\amp = n\cdot (n+1)  </mrow>
  </md>
  Therefore, the equation above gives
  <me>
    2S=n(n+1)
  </me>
   from which it follows that
  <me>
    S = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \, .
  </me>
</p>
</proof>
