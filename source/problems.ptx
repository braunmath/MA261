        <p> 
            Go to <url href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-94-007-2129-6"/> and download the book <em>Proof and Proving in Mathematics Education</em>.
            Your essay will be a response to parts of Chapter 2, titled "Cognitive Development of Proof".
            Read the following sections of this chapter:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Section 2, "Perceptions of Proof", including both Subsections 2.1 and 2.2, page numbers 14-16.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Subsection 3.3, "A Global Framework for the Development of Mathematical Thinking", page numbers 23-25.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            After you read these sections, complete the following essay.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        This will be an essay of length at least 500 words, which is equivalent to at least 2 typed pages with 1 inch margins, 12 point Times New Roman font, double spaced. (You can write a longer essay if needed.)
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Your essay should respond to the following three questions.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    What are 2-3 experiences you have with mathematical proofs in your previous mathematics courses (both high school and college)?
                                    How do these experiences relate to the discussion of proof for mathematicians and for growing individuals discussed in Section 2 of the article?
                                </p>
                            </li>

                                <p>
                                    What are examples of work you have done in your previous mathematics courses that represent "embodied", "symbolic", and "formal" modes of mathematical thinking, as described in Subsection 3.3 of the article?
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    What is one thing that you read in these sections that made sense to you? Why?
                                    What is one thing that you read in these sections that did not make sense to you? Why was it confusing? What questions do you have about it?
                                </p>
                            </li>

        <title>P1</title>
        <p>
            For a real number <m>x\in \mathbb{R}</m>, define the <em>floor function</em> <m>\lfloor x \rfloor</m> to be the greatest integer less than or equal to <m>x</m>. 
            For example, <m>\lfloor 3.7 \rfloor = 3</m>, <m>\lfloor -2.1 \rfloor = -3</m>, and <m>\lfloor 5 \rfloor = 5</m>.
            The SageMath command to compute the floor is "floor(x)".
        </p>
        <p>
            Let <m>N</m> and <m>m</m> be positive integers. 
            The goal of this problem is to explore why the number of multiples of <m>m</m> between <m>1</m> and <m>N</m> (inclusive) is given by <m>\left\lfloor \frac{N}{m} \right\rfloor</m>.
            <ol>

        <title>P2</title>
        <p>
            In this problem, you will complete several computational exercises using SageMath.
            Before starting this problem, you should read <xref ref="123ncoding"/>.
            These exercises will require you to modify the code found in that section.

    <problem>
        <title>P3</title>
            <p>
            Consider the equation 
            <me>1+3+5+\cdots+(2n-1)=n^2\, .
            </me>
            <ol>

                    <p>
                        Draw a picture that demonstrates why this is true for all positive integers <m>n</m>.
                        Explain how your picture is related to the equation.
                        (This is an "embodied" proof.)

                    <p>
                        Give a "symbolic" proof of this equation by rewriting the numbers in the sum and using properties of sums that we have discussed in class.
                        Hint: write each odd number as <m>2k-1=k+(k-1)</m>.

                Hint: Begin both of these with small examples. 
                What happens when <m>n=1,2,3,4</m>?
                How can you use these examples to guide your thinking about the general case?

                        The command in SageMath for <m>n!</m> is "factorial(n)", while the command for <m>2^n</m> is "2^n".
                        Provide either a screenshot or printout or notebook link for your code and results.

        <p>
            Watch the following video from <em>3Blue1Brown</em> (19 minutes, published July 2023): <url href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYQVlVoWoPY"/> 
            After you watch this video, complete the following essay.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    This will be an essay of length 500 words, which is equivalent to 2 typed pages with 1 inch margins, 12 point Times New Roman font, double spaced. 
                </p>

            <li>
                <p>
                    The video introduced three false proofs, one related to spherical surface area, one related to finding the value of <m>\pi</m>, and one supposedly proving that all triangles are equilateral.
                    Which of these three false proofs did you find most interesting, and why?
                    Which of these three false proofs did you find least interesting, and why?
                    You need to give specific details in the video that support your opinions.

                    What is something about mathematical proof that this video made you consider that you had not thought of before?
                    Do you feel that this new insight will help you as you work on proofs in this course? Why or why not?

            <li>
                <p>
                    How are the ideas of the embodied, symbolic, and formal modes of mathematical thinking (from the reading for Essay 1) related to the ideas introduced in this video?
                    Does this video make you think differently about these modes of mathematical thinking? Why or why not?

            Read the following blog post by Keith Weber, a professor of math education at Rutgers University who studies how undergraduate students understand proofs in mathematics: <url href="https://blogs.ams.org/matheducation/2015/02/10/mathematics-professors-and-mathematics-majors-expectations-of-lectures-in-advanced-mathematics/" />
            After you read this article, complete the following essay.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        This will be an essay of length at least 500 words, which is equivalent to at least 2 typed pages with 1 inch margins, 12 point Times New Roman font, double spaced. (You can write a longer essay if needed.)

                                    The article describes four expectations that professors have for students, but which are usually mis-communicated. <em>For each of these four expectations</em>, do you respond more like the students in their surveys, or more like the professors? Why?

                                    The discussion at the end of the article has some recommendations for faculty in their courses. Which of these recommendations do you think you would find most helpful for your learning, and why?

The student learning outcomes list various mathematical practices that students will develop in MA 261, in addition to the content-based learning outcomes. Which of these practices do you feel you have improved on the most so far this semester? Which do you are most in need of further development?                                
                                </p>

        <title>Essay 6</title>
        <p>

            Watch the following YouTube video from <em>Quanta Magazine</em> (17 minutes, published January 2021): <url href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/videos/the-riemann-hypothesis-explained/" />

After you watch this video, complete the following essay.
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            This will be an essay of length 500 words, which is equivalent to 2 typed pages with 1 inch margins, 12 point Times New Roman font, double spaced. 
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Write a critical review of this video.
      Imagine that you are writing your review for a journal for undergraduates in mathematics and the sciences, so your primary audience is undergraduate math/cs/engineering/etc majors and minors.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Like any critic, you will respond positively to some things and negatively to others.  
        Unlike many critics, you need to justify your opinions and provide detailed explanations for your claims.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

        <p>
            You should consider the following questions:
        </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Does the video effectively communicate the mathematics it discusses? Why or why not? Justify your claims with specific details about the video.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                We have discussed multiple approaches/themes to prime numbers in this course.
                Which of these approaches/themes to prime numbers are used in this video? Be detailed, give specific examples from the video!
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Is the mathematics clearly explained? If yes, what did they do especially well? If no, what made it unclear? Again, justify your claims with specific examples from the video.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>    
  
Your grade is based on completion only (in other words, if you complete the assignment and it meets the length requirement and responds appropriately to the prompt, then you get full credit).

        <title>End-of-Class Reflection</title>
        <p>
            Type a 1000 word essay in response to the following prompt.
This is the equivalent of 4 pages in 12 point Times New Roman font, double-spaced.

<ol>
<li>
    <p>What were <em>six</em> of the most important discoveries or realizations you made in this class?
In other words, what are you taking away from this class that you think might stick with you over time  and/or influence you in the future?
What have you experienced that might have a long-term effect on you intellectually or personally?
These can include things you had not realized about mathematics or society, specific homework problems or theorems, etc.
These can be things that made sense to you, or topics where you were confused, points that you agreed/disagreed with in the readings or class discussions, issues that arose while working on your assignments, etc.
    </p>
</li>
<li>
    <p>
        Explain why these six discoveries or realizations are important to you.
    </p>
</li>
<li>
    <p>
        You should include a combination of observations about <em>both</em> mathematics <em>and</em> your habits, practices, and beliefs about mathematics.
    </p>
</li>
</ol>
This assignment grade is based only on completion (i.e. if you turn it in, it meets the length requirement, and it appropriately responds to the prompt above, then you get full credit).
