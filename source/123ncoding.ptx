  <title>Introduction to SageMath</title>

  <p>
    If you are familiar with coding in Python, then this should be very familiar.
    If not, then this section will give you the background you need to conduct basic experiments in number theory.

    SageMath is open source software for mathematical computation.
    It is a Python-based language that incorporates many powerful packages for computing in math. 
    There are two straightforward options for coding in SageMath.
