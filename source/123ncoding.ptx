  <title>Computational Experiments in SageMath</title>

  <p>
    If you are familiar with coding in Python, then this should be very familiar.
    If not, then this section will give you the background you need to conduct basic experiments in number theory.
  </p>

  <p>
    <url href="https://www.sagemath.org/">SageMath</url> is open source software for mathematical computation.
    It is a Python-based language that incorporates many powerful packages for computing in math. 
    There are two straightforward options for coding in SageMath.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          You can use the free website <url href="https://sagecell.sagemath.org/">SageCell</url> to do basic computations in SageMath.
          In SageCell, you are not able to save your work, so if you primarily use this for your coding, I recommend saving your code in a separate file so you have access to it later.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          You can sign up for a free account at <url href="https://cocalc.com/">CoCalc</url>.
          CoCalc gives you access to Jupyter notebooks running SageMath that you can save to your account.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    We will now go through a few basic aspects of coding in Python/SageMath that are useful for computational experimentation.
    Note that a list of objects in SageMath is stored between two brackets.
    For example, the following code will assign to "L" the list of odd numbers from 1 to 10 and then print the list:
  </p>
  <program language="sage">
    <input>
      L = [1,3,5,7,9]
      print(L)
    </input>
  </program>

  <p>
    If you copy and paste that into SageCell, you will get the list printed.
  </p>

  <definition xml:id="def-range">
    <statement>
      <p>
        To generate the numbers from <m>0</m> to <m>n-1</m>, use the following command.
        Note that to actually use this, you have to specify what <m>n</m> is.
      </p>
      <program language="sage">
        range(n)
        </program>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    Note that the range command will generate <m>n</m> numbers, but it will start at 0 and end at <m>n-1</m>.
    Copy and paste the following code into SageCell, and change the value of <m>n</m> a few times.
    To make a list of numbers from the range generator, we use the "list" command.
  </p>

  <program language="sage">
    n = 7
    list(range(n))
  </program>

  <definition xml:id="def-forloop">
    <statement>
      <p>
        A "for loop" will iterate through a list (or any other iterable collection of objects).
        The structure of a "for loop" is:
      </p>
      <program language="sage">
        for "name your objects" in "list or other iterable":
            "do something"
      </program>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    So, for example, if you want to print the numbers <m>i^2</m> for <m>i</m> from <m>1</m> to <m>20</m>, you would use the following code.
    Copy and paste this into SageCell, and then explore what happens when you change the value of <m>n</m>, or when you change the exponent on <m>i</m>.
  </p>
  <program language="sage">
    n = 21
    for i in range(1,n):
        print(i^2)
  </program>

  <p>
    We often want to go through a list of numbers and check them for certain properties.
    To do this, we use an "if" statement.
  </p>

  <definition xml:id="def-ifstatements">
    <statement>
      <p>
        To check a condition, we use an "if" statement as follows:
      </p>
      <program language="sage">
        if "condition":
            "do something"
      </program>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    So, for example, if you want to go through the numbers from 1 to 50 and only print the multiples of 3, then you would need to do the following:
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          use a for loop from 1 to 50,
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          check if each value is divisible by 3,
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          if it is divisible by 3, print the value.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    The way we check divisibility is to compute the remainder when dividing by 3 and checking to see if it is 0.
    To compute the remainder of <m>n</m> divided by <m>k</m>, use the following command:
  </p>
  <program language="sage">
    <input>
      n % k
    </input>
  </program>
  <p>
    To check if two things are equal, we use "==". 
    To check if two values are not equal, we use "!=".
  </p>
  <p>
    So, the following code will print only numbers divisible by 3.
  </p>
  <program language="sage">
    <input>
      for i in range(1,51):
          if i % 3 == 0:
              print(i)
    </input>
  </program>
  <p>
    The following program will print the numbers that are not divisible by 3.
  </p>

  <program language="sage">
    <input>
      for i in range(1,51):
          if i % 3 != 0:
              print(i)
    </input>
  </program>

  <definition xml:id="def-append">
    <statement>
      <p>
        We can store values in a list, which we discussed earlier.
    To include a new value <m>k</m> at the end of a list <m>L</m>, we use the "append" method.
  </p>
  <program language="sage">
    <input>
      L.append(k)
    </input>
  </program>
    </statement>
  </definition>
    
  <p>
    So, for example, if we want to make a list of all numbers from 1 to 50 that are divisible by 3, we first create an empty list <m>L</m> and then append the numbers that are divisible by 3.
  </p>
  <program language="sage">
    <input>
      L = []
      for i in range(1,51):
          if i % 3 == 0:
              L.append(i)
      print(L)
    </input>
  </program>

  <p>
    If we have a pair <m>[a,b]</m>, we can store those pairs in a list as well.
    We can then plot those pairs using the "points" command.
  </p>

  <program language="sage">
    <input>
      L = [[1,3],[2,5],[3,7],[4,4],[5,10]]
      points(L)
    </input>
  </program>

  <p>
    So, for example, suppose you want to find the remainder for each number <m>n</m> from 1 to 100 after you divide by 7, and the plot the pairs <m>[n,remainder]</m>.
    You would use this code.
  </p>

  <program language="sage">
    <input>
      L = []
      k = 7
      for n in range(101):
          remainder = n % k
          L.append([n,remainder])
      points(L)
    </input>
  </program>

  <p>
    As our final example, let's make a list of all the numbers from 1 to 500 that are divisible by 5 but not divisible by 7.
    Then, let's make a plot of the point <m>[i,\lfloor i/10 \rfloor]</m> for each of those numbers, where <m>\lfloor i/10 \rfloor</m> is the floor function defined in Problem P1, computed using the command "floor(i/10)".
    Note the use of the "and" structure to check multiple conditions.
  </p>
  <program language="sage">
    <input>
      values = []
      for n in range(1,501):
          if (n % 5 == 0) and (n % 7 != 0):
              values.append(n)
      pairs = []
      for i in values:
          pairs.append([i,floor(i/10)])
      points(pairs)
    </input>
  </program>

  <p>
    Finally, we need to know how to find the length of a list.
  </p>

  <definition xml:id="def-length">
    <statement>
      <p>
        To compute the length of a list <m>L</m>, use the following command.
      </p>
      <program language="sage">
        <input>
          len(L)
        </input>
      </program>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    For example, if we want to count how many numbers less than <m>n</m> are divisible by 5 but not divisible by 7, we can use the following code.
  </p>

  <program language="sage">
    <input>
      n = 501
      values = []
      for i in range(1,n):
          if (i % 5 == 0) and (i % 7 != 0):
              values.append(i)
      print(len(values))
    </input>
  </program>
