  <title>The Euclidean Algorithm</title>

  <p>
    We started the previous section by looking at linear Diophantine equations of the form <me>ax + by = c</me>, where <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m> are given integers and we want to find integer solutions <m>x,y</m>.
    What we observed is that there seems to be a connection between the solvability of this equation and the greatest common divisor of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
    In this section, we will develop the theory of greatest common divisors using the division algorithm.

    Recall that in <xref ref="prop-gcdlcmfactorizations"/> we showed how to compute the greatest common divisor of two numbers if you know the prime factorizations of those numbers.
    Unfortunately, it is famously difficult to find the prime factorization of large numbers.
    In fact, the security of many modern cryptographic systems relies on this difficulty, see <url>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization</url> for more information.
    So, we need to find a better way to compute greatest common divisors without having to factor the numbers first.

    Fortunately, this was first accomplished by the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid around 300 BC.
    This is the same Euclid who wrote <em>The Elements</em>, one of the most influential works in the history of mathematics, and whose proof of the infinitude of primes we saw previously in the course.
    Our development of the Euclidean algorithm follows Weissman's development in his book <em>An Illustrated Theory of Numbers</em>.
