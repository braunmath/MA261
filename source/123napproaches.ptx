  <title>Ways to Explore a Problem</title>

  <p>
    Let's discuss a few useful principles for approaching mathematical problems, which also apply to writing mathematical proofs.
  </p>

  <principle xml:id="principle-smallexamples">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Work out small examples with pencil and paper.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </principle>

  <exercise>
    <p>
      Explore the sum <m>1+2+3+\cdots+n</m> for small values of <m>n</m> by computing the sums for <m>n=1,2,3,4,5</m>.
      What patterns do you notice, if any?
    </p>
  </exercise>


    <principle xml:id="principle-drawapicture">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Draw various pictures or diagrams to visualize the problem, theorem, definition, etc.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </principle>

    <exercise>
      <p>
        Can you draw a picture to represent the sum <m>1+2+3+\cdots+n</m>?
        How might such a picture help you understand the problem better?
      </p>
    </exercise>

      <principle xml:id="principle-computationalexperiments">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Use a computer to conduct experiments and generate data.
      </p>
    </statement>
    </principle>

    <exercise>
      <p>
        The software system SageMath is extremely useful for mathematics; a simple interface is available for free at <url href="https://sagecell.sagemath.org/">https://sagecell.sagemath.org/</url>.
        You can also install SageMath on your computer, or you can use it through a web browser via services such as CoCalc <url href="https://cocalc.com/">https://cocalc.com/</url>.
        Here is a simple SageMath command to compute the sum <m>1+2+3+\cdots+n</m> for a given positive integer <m>n</m>:
      </p>
      <program language="sage">
      for n in range(1,11):
          print(n, sum([k for k in range(1, n+1)]))
      </program>
    </exercise>

    <p>
      Your goal in these exercises is to gather data and look for patterns that can help you formulate a conjecture about the value of the sum <m>1+2+3+\cdots+n</m> for a general positive integer <m>n</m>.
    </p>
