  <title>Exploration Leads to Conjecture</title>

  <p>
    Let's discuss a few useful principles for exploring mathematical questions, which also apply to creating mathematical proofs.
  </p>

  <principle xml:id="principle-smallexamples">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Work out small examples with pencil and paper.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </principle>

  <exercise>
    <p>
      Explore the sum <m>1+2+3+\cdots+n</m> for small values of <m>n</m> by computing the sums for <m>n=1,2,3,4,5</m>.
      What patterns do you notice, if any?
    </p>

    <principle xml:id="principle-drawapicture">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Draw various pictures or diagrams to visualize the problem, theorem, definition, etc.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </principle>

    <exercise>
      <p>
        Can you draw a picture to represent the sum <m>1+2+3+\cdots+n</m>?
        How might such a picture help you understand the problem better?
      </p>

      <principle xml:id="principle-computationalexperiments">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Use a computer to conduct experiments and generate data.
      </p>
    </statement>
    </principle>

        The software system SageMath is extremely useful for mathematics, and it is built on top of Python, so if you know some Python it is very familiar.
        A simple SageMath interface is available for free at <url href="https://sagecell.sagemath.org/">https://sagecell.sagemath.org/</url>.
        You can also install SageMath on your computer, or you can use it through a web browser via services such as CoCalc <url href="https://cocalc.com/">https://cocalc.com/</url>.
        Here is a simple SageMath command to compute the sum <m>1+2+3+\cdots+n</m> for a given positive integer <m>n</m>:
      </p>
      <program language="sage">
      for n in range(1,11):
          print(n, sum([k for k in range(1, n+1)]))
      </program>
      <p>
        It is always helpful to try to visualize sequences of numbers, rather than just look at the numerical output.
        For example, here is code to create a plot of the values <m>1+2+3+\cdots+n</m> for <m>n=1,2,\ldots,15</m> as points of the form <m>(n,1+2+\cdots+n)</m>.
        
      </p>
      <program language="sage">
        L = []

        for n in range(1,16):
            L.append([n, sum([k for k in range(1, n+1)])])
            
        points(L,xmax=50,ymax=120)
      </program>

    <exercise>
      <p>
        What type of function does this point plot look like the graph of?
      </p>

      Based on the explorations above, we might conjecture that the sum <m>1+2+3+\cdots+n</m> is given by a quadratic function of <m>n</m>.
      So, suppose that there are constants <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m> such that the equality
      <me>
        1+2+3+\cdots+n = an^2 + bn + c
      </me> 
      holds for all positive integers <m>n</m>.
      Using the small values we computed earlier for <m>n=1,2,3</m>, we can set up a system of equations to solve for <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m>.
      <md>
        <mrow>1 \amp = a(1)^2 + b(1) + c</mrow>
        <mrow>1+2 \amp = a(2)^2 + b(2) + c</mrow>
        <mrow>1+2+3 \amp = a(3)^2 + b(3) + c</mrow>
      </md>
      Solving for <m>a,b</m>, and <m>c</m> (for example, by back substitution), we find that <m>a=\frac{1}{2}, b=\frac{1}{2}, c=0</m>, so we have the following conjecture.
      <conjecture xml:id="conj-123nsum">
        <statement>
          <p>
            <me>1+2+3+\cdots+n = \frac{1}{2}n^2 + \frac{1}{2}n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}</me>
          </p>
        </statement>
      </conjecture> 
    </p>
