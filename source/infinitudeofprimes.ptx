  <title>Infinitude of Primes
  </title>

  <p>
    The most important question about primes that was asked in ancient times is the following.
  </p>

  <question>
    <p>
      How many primes are there?
      Are there only finitely many?
      Or are there infinitely many?
    </p>
  </question>

  <p>
    The answer to this question is the following theorem, found in <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements">Euclid's Elements</url>.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="thm-infinitudeofprimes">
    <statement>
      <p>
        There are infinitely many primes.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <p>
    We will give two versions of Euclid's proof.
    The first is a <alert>constructive</alert> proof.
  </p>

  <proof>
    <p>
      Start with the prime <m>2</m>.
      We will apply the following operation: given a set of primes <m>p_1,\ldots,p_k</m>, produce the number <m>N=p_1p_2\cdots p_k+1</m>.
      We will call this a <em>Euclid step</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
  </proof>
