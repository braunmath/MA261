  <title>Infinitude of Primes
  </title>

  <p>
    The most important question about primes that was asked in ancient times is the following.
  </p>

  <question>
    <p>
      How many primes are there?
      Are there only finitely many?
      Or are there infinitely many?
    </p>
  </question>

  <p>
    The answer to this question is the following theorem, found in <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements">Euclid's Elements</url>.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="thm-infinitudeofprimes">
    <statement>
      <p>
        There are infinitely many primes.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <p>
    We will give two versions of Euclid's proof.
    The first is a <alert>constructive</alert> proof.
  </p>

  <proof>
    <p>
      We will apply the following operation: given a set of primes <m>p_1,\ldots,p_k</m>, produce the number <m>N=p_1p_2\cdots p_k+1</m>.
      We will call this a <em>Euclid step</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that <m>p_1</m> does not divide <m>N</m>, since dividing <m>N</m> by <m>p_1</m> leaves a remainder of <m>1</m>.
      Similarly, dividing <m>N</m> by <m>p_2</m> leaves a remainder of <m>1</m>.
      The same holds for every <m>p_i</m>.
      Therefore, <m>N</m> is a number that is not divisible by any of the primes we have, and by <xref ref="thm-primesdividenumbers"/>, there is a new prime <m>p_{k+1}</m> that divides <m>N</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, starting with <m>p_1=2</m>, we obtain the prime <m>2+1=3</m>.
      From there, we can produce the prime <m>2\cdot3+1=7</m>.
      From there, we can produce the prime <m>2\cdot 3 \cdot 7 +1=43</m>.
      From there, we can produce the number <m>2\cdot 3 \cdot 7 \cdot 43 +1= 1807 =13\cdot 139</m>.
      We can pick either of <m>13</m> or <m>139</m> to add to our list of primes.
    </p>
    <p>
      With each application of a Euclid step, we produce a new prime.
      Thus, this yields an algorithm for constructing an infinite sequence of prime numbers.
    </p>
  </proof>
  
  <exercise>
    <p>
      What are the first few primes do you get when you start this process with the prime <m>11</m> instead of the prime <m>2</m> as your first value?
    </p>

    <p>
      What makes sense about this proof?
      Do you feel that this proof is primarily embodied, symbolic, formal, or a combination of these worlds? Why?
