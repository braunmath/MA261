  <title>Infinitude of Primes
  </title>

  <p>
    The most important question about primes that was asked in ancient times is the following.
  </p>

  <assumption>
    <p>
      How many primes are there?
      Are there only finitely many?
      Or are there infinitely many?
    </p>
  </assumption>

  <p>
    Let's look at some data.
    Define <m>\pi(n)</m> to be the number of primes less than or equal to <m>n</m>.
    (Here <m>\pi</m> is the Greek letter corresponding to "p", not the number <m>3.14\ldots</m>.)
    So, for example, 
    <me>
      \pi(10)=4
    </me>
    since <m>2,3,5,7</m> are the four primes less than or equal to <m>10</m>.    
  </p>

  <p>
    The following code will plot a point at <m>[p,\pi(p)]</m> for every prime <m>p</m> up to <m>100</m>.
    What happens if we change the upper bound to <m>1000</m>?
  </p>

  <program language="sage">
    <input>
      L = []
      M = 100
      for i in range(M):
          if i in Primes():
              L.append([i,len(L)+1])
      points(L,xmax=M,ymax=M)
    </input>
  </program>

  <p>
    As was discovered thousands of years ago, the answer to our question is the following theorem, recorded in <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements">Euclid's Elements</url>.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="thm-infinitudeofprimes">
    <statement>
      <p>
        There are infinitely many primes.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <p>
    We will give two versions of Euclid's proof.
    The first is a <alert>constructive</alert> proof.
  </p>

  <proof>
    <p>
      We will apply the following operation: given a set of primes <m>p_1,\ldots,p_k</m>, produce the number <m>N=p_1p_2\cdots p_k+1</m>.
      We will call this a <em>Euclid step</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that <m>p_1</m> does not divide <m>N</m>, since dividing <m>N</m> by <m>p_1</m> leaves a remainder of <m>1</m>.
      Similarly, dividing <m>N</m> by <m>p_2</m> leaves a remainder of <m>1</m>.
      The same holds for every <m>p_i</m>.
      Therefore, <m>N</m> is a number that is not divisible by any of the primes we have, and by <xref ref="thm-primesdividenumbers"/>, there is a new prime <m>p_{k+1}</m> that divides <m>N</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, starting with <m>p_1=2</m>, we obtain the prime <m>2+1=3</m>.
      From there, we can produce the prime <m>2\cdot3+1=7</m>.
      From there, we can produce the prime <m>2\cdot 3 \cdot 7 +1=43</m>.
      From there, we can produce the number <m>2\cdot 3 \cdot 7 \cdot 43 +1= 1807 =13\cdot 139</m>.
      We can pick either of <m>13</m> or <m>139</m> to add to our list of primes.
    </p>
    <p>
      With each application of a Euclid step, we produce a new prime.
      Thus, this yields an algorithm for constructing an infinite sequence of prime numbers.
    </p>
  </proof>
  
  <exercise>
    <p>
      What are the first few primes do you get when you start this process with the prime <m>11</m> instead of the prime <m>2</m> as your first value?
    </p>
  </exercise>

  <exercise>
    <p>
      What makes sense about this proof?
      Do you feel that this proof is primarily embodied, symbolic, formal, or a combination of these worlds? Why?
    </p>
  </exercise>

  <p>
    Next we will consider Euclid's original version of this proof, which is a <alert>proof by contradiction</alert>.
    In a proof by contradiction, you suppose that the result is false, and show that this leads to a contradiction, hence the result must be true.
  </p>

  <proof>
    <p>
      Suppose for contradiction that there are only finitely many primes, call them <m>p_1,\ldots,p_k</m>.
      If we apply a Euclid step (as defined in the previous proof) to these primes, then this produces a new prime that is not in our list.
      This contradicts our assumption that there are only finitely many primes, and thus there must be infinitely many primes.
    </p>
  </proof>

  <exercise>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Discuss the proof by contradiction.
      Does it make sense why this shows there are infinitely many primes?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
      Which proof do you prefer, the constructive or contradiction proof?
      Why?
          </p>
